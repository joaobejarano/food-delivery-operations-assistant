# 🚀 Smart Operations Assistant – Food Delivery

This project is a **smart operations assistant MVP** for food delivery platforms. It predicts demand, identifies operational bottlenecks, and suggests intelligent actions using historical data, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and GPT.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Support logistics and operations teams in **making fast, informed decisions** using AI-powered forecasting and generative insights.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Concepts

- Python + Pandas + Faker (simulated realistic data)
- **Streamlit** (interactive dashboard)
- **LangChain + ChromaDB** (RAG pipeline for contextual retrieval)
- **OpenAI GPT-4** (generating actionable suggestions)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (embeddings)
- **Prophet** or **XGBoost** (time series forecasting)
- **Plotly** (data visualization)

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 📦 View operational data: orders, delivery times, courier load, etc.
- 📈 Predict demand by hour and region
- 🧠 Generate GPT-4 insights based on retrieved context
- 🔍 Retrieve similar past operational incidents using RAG
- ☁️ Streamlit-powered visual interface
